 * This class builds a prepared statement SQL fragment that will be used to filter a entity set before loading it.
 *
 * It will generate the correct form of clauses to account for property multiplicity and should result in queries that
 * can be pushed down to numeric tables.
 *
 * TODO: We should differentiate between large and small text fields. The postgres indexer has a limit on the maximum
 * size of the field it can index thus it will do scans when doing range queries on strings (as we don't index those fields)
